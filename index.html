In the context of formal education, the subject supports personal, social, moral, spiritual, cultural and creative development of the children and enables them to explore visual tactile and other sensory experience to recognize and communicate ideas and meanings. These opportunities enable them to work with traditional and various new mediums so that they develop confidence, competence, imagination and creativity. </p>
